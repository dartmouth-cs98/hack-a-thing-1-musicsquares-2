# TODO: Maybe in the future, you could designate at which certain beat to explode at
# TODO: Maybe implement health collectable on the field. It is destroyed by explosions but player must navigate towards it to get it.
# TODO: Implement a field that determines which kind of camera shake to invoke, as well as the volume to set for the explosion (too loud sometimes played together)
# TODO: An infinite repeat functionality and a turn off functionality as well.
